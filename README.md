# FoodTruckProject

# Description
This is an application designed for the owner of up to five food trucks. My application allows the owner to input the truck name, food it serves and its yelp rating! After inputting your food trucks information you will be able to view all the trucks stored in memory, display your highest rated truck or view the average rating of all the trucks! 

# Technologies Used
I used a scanner to read the users input inside of a for loop to keep my code dry and readable.

Once receiving the data I placed it into an array of objects for safe keeping and ability to access later on when prompted inside my switch.

Depending on what I was prompted by the user I activated a switch that used getters, setters and a toString method to display the requested data.

Finally I wrapped one of my menus in a boolean to dictate when the user decided to exit the program.

# What I Learned
I learned how to take in data via a scanner and create an object using that information then placing it into an array of objects, how to increment correctly so the data pulled from my getter matches the object it is assigned to and the most difficult thing, placing all of that data onto the console when prompted by the user.

The most important take away for me was learning to relax and take a break when needed, when stuck on an issue often times I would just take my mind off of it for a couple minutes and do something else like take a walk outside then when returning to my problem I would typically find it in a matter of seconds. This project greatly improved my understanding of arrays, getters/setters and toStrings.
